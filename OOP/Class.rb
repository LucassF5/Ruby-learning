# attr_accessor: creates a getter and a setter for the instance variable
# attr_reader: creates a getter for the instance variable
# attr_writer: creates a setter for the instance variable

# attr methods are used to create getter and setter methods for instance variables
# It's a way to avoid writing getter and setter methods manually
